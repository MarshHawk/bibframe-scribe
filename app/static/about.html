        <h2>About the BIBFRAME Scribe prototype</h2>

        <div class="well">
            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>The Scribe prototype is a tool developed
                by <a href="http://zepheira.com/">Zepheira</a> that
                demonstrates how to catalog various materials natively in Linked Data. Initially supported by the <a href="http://loc.goc/">Library
                    of Congress</a>, Scribe has matured with additional support from
                <a href="https://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis University Library</a>
                as part of the <a href="https://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/bibflow/about/">BIBFLOW project</a>
                funded by the
                <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute for Museum and
                    Library Services</a>. Feedback from
                Zepheira's <a href="http://zepheira.com/solutions/library/training/">Linked
                    Data and BIBFRAME Practical Practitioner Training</a> Alumni
                have also been invaluable in Scribe's continued development.</p>

            <p>This prototype is designed to demonstrate how one would
                catalog entities using the <a href="http://bibfra.me/">Bibframe Lite</a> vocabulary.
                Bibframe Lite is an RDF vocabulary designed
                to integrate with and engage in the wider information
                community while also serving the very specific needs of
                local implementation. Zepheira works with a range of
                communities to extend the Bibframe Lite vocabulary. These
                additional vocabulary layers include:

            <ul>
                <li>BF Lite + Library</li>
                <li>BF Lite + Archives</li>
                <li>BF Lite + Rare Materials</li>
                <li>BF Lite + Relation</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        </div>


        <h3>Prototype Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate how components of the Bibframe Lite framework come together in an editing platform.</li>
            <li>Provide a method to examine workflows for cataloging in native Bibframe Lite.</li>
            <li>Explore common relationships between Works such as translations, derivative works, etc.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate how different vocabularies are accommodated in a single interface.</li>
            <li>Explore the ability to link to external services that are needed in workflows, such as VIAF, Library of
                Congress.
            </li>
            <li>Demonstrate unique data entry features such as “look ahead” searches of remote services and a drag and
                drop image zone for images.
            </li>
            <li>Show possible future functionality such as user activity dashboard via mock-up pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prototype Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scribe uses 32 different profiles to demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, including 12 modular
                micro-profiles for Events, Categories and Concepts. Scribe also includes profiles for electionic and
                print versions of followingm and all of thish containue default values which can be edited by the
                cataloger: :
                <ul>
                    <li>Bibliography</li>
                    <li>Book</li>
                    <li>Dissertation</li>
                    <li>Article</li>
                    <li>Vinyl record</li>
                    <li>Map</li>
                    <li>Serial</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Interface reflects a subset of the BIBFRAME Lite + Library vocabularies. The interface guides you to the
                particular instance and brings up only fields that are pertinent to that instance type.
            </li>
            <li>Search allows users to find local material and select for additional curation and editing.</li>
            <li>Uses remote search services:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://id.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Linked Data Service</a> (names, subjects,
                        languages, places, RDA categories)
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="http://oclc.org/research/activities/assignfast.html">assignFAST</a> (subjects)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://viaf.org/">VIAF</a> (names, subjects)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/about">AGROVOC</a> (subjects)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/">Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) RDF Linked Data (subjects)</a>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Support identifier disambiguation of subjects, people, and other resources by providing access to data
                from remote search service in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. For services that support
                human readable content negotiation, users can click a link to open the RDF displayed in a new browser
                tab for context.
            </li>
        </ul>
