        <h3>About the BIBFRAME Scribe prototype</h3>
        <div class="jumbotron">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The BIBFRAME Scribe prototype is a tool developed by <a href="http://zepheira.com/">Zepheira</a> that demonstrates how to catalog various materials in native BIBFRAME.  As a linked data framework on the web, BIBFRAME is designed to integrate with and engage in the wider information community while also serving the very specific needs of local implementation.</p>
          <p>This prototype is designed to demonstrate how one would catalog entities in BIBFRAME, how the workflow is integrated with web services, and how to move between multiple types of entities in a single tool. BIBFRAME is designed to work with existing standards (RDA, DACS, VRA, etc.) and yet-to-be-developed community vocabularies.  For demonstration purposes, this prototype uses initial drafts for a small set of material types.</p>
          <p>This prototype is a work in progress and is not yet aligned with the various BIBFRAME draft specifications and design patterns.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Status: Pre-release demonstration</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrate how components of the BIBFRAME framework come together in an editing platform.</li>
          <li>Provide a method to examine workflows for cataloging in native BIBFRAME.</li>
          <li>Explore common relationships between Works such as translations, derivative works, etc.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate how different vocabularies are accommodated in a single interface.</li>
          <li>Explore the ability to link to external services that are needed in workflows, such as VIAF, Library of Congress.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate unique data entry features such as “look ahead” searches of remote services and a drag and drop image zone for images.</li>
          <li>Show possible future functionality such as user activity dashboard via mock-up pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Prototype Functionality Facts</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses eight different profiles to demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, including electronic and print instances of:
            <ul>
              <li>Bibliography</li>
              <li>Book</li>
              <li>Dissertation</li>
            </ul>
            all of which contain some default values, some of which are read-only, and some of which can be subsequently edited by the user.
          </li>
          <li>Seeded with 15 records converted from MARCXML.</li>
          <li>Interface reflects a subset of the BIBFRAME vocabulary.  The interface guides you to the particular instance and brings up only fields that are pertinent to that instance type.</li>
          <li>Local search for instances and all other resources</li>
          <li>Uses remote search services:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://id.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Linked Data Service</a> (names, subjects, languages, places, RDA categories)</li>
              <li><a href="http://oclc.org/research/activities/assignfast.html">assignFAST</a> (subjects)</li>
              <li><a href="http://viaf.org/">VIAF</a> (names, subjects)</li>
              <li><a href="http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/about">AGROVOC</a> (subjects)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
